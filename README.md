- Galoblender is a mod that repairs the compatibility between [Galosphere](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/galosphere) and [Terrablender](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrablender). It was a part of [Genesis: Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/genesis-pack), the dedicated mod for the [GENESIS modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/genesis-pack), and has since been split off into its own mod for independent usage.

- **This is a coremod that hooks into Galosphere!** It disable's Galosphere's ability to register its own Terrablender region so Galoblender can register its own on top of it.
- This mod requires both Galosphere and Terrablender.
- Since this mod is primarily written for GENESIS, it will follow through the needs of that modpack. Requests for ports to other versions and mod loaders will be ignored.

- Fixes Galosphere biomes not (or rarely) generating in worlds that use Terrablender.
- The weight of the Galosphere region can be changed in its common configuration file.
