- Genesis: Core is the dedicated mod for the [GENESIS modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/genesis-pack). It adds custom content, modifications to existing mods, and bug fixes to dead mods present in the pack.

- **It is not recommended to use this mod outside of [GENESIS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/genesis-pack),** as a lot of stuff have been tuned to work specifically in the modpack.

- Contains several fixes and reworks for mods within, and exclusive to, GENESIS.
- Disallows showing most debug info on the F3 screen unless the player has game master (operator) permissions or is in creative mode.
- Completely revamps Minecraft's music playback system.
  - Each "music" type in the game now must exhaust all tracks before they can be played again. It's like putting a Spotify playlist on shuffle without repeating any songs.
- Adds an updated respawn system, which allows players to respawn either near their death location (if possible) or on their spawn point.
- Enforces the usage of the Moyai block in order to summon Iron, Tuff, and Copper Golems.
  - Snow Golems are still summoned with a Carved Pumpkin.
