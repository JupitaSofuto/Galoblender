- Galoblender is a mod that repairs the compatibility between [Galosphere](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/galosphere) and [TerraBlender](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrablender). It was a part of [Genesis: Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/genesis-pack), the dedicated mod for the [GENESIS modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/genesis-pack), and has since been split off into its own mod for independent usage.

- **This is a coremod that hooks into Galosphere!** It disables Galosphere's ability to register its own TerraBlender region so Galoblender can register its own on top of it.
- This mod requires both Galosphere and TerraBlender.
- Since this mod is primarily written for GENESIS, it will follow through the needs of that modpack. Requests for ports to other versions and mod loaders will be ignored.
  - If you want this mod ported to other versions or loaders, feel free to do so on your own. This mod is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-sa-4.0/).
